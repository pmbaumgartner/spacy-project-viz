setup(
    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
    name="spacy-project-viz",  # Required
    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
    #
    # For a discussion on single-sourcing the version across setup.py and the
    # project code, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/single_source_version.html
    version="0.0.1",  # Required
    # This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
    # corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
    description="CLI Tool to help generate a mermaid.js or graphviz chart of commands, dependencies, outputs, and optionally variables from a spaCy project.yml file.",  # Optional

    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#home-page-optional
    url="https://github.com/pmbaumgartner/spacy-project-viz",  # Optional
    # This should be your name or the name of the organization which owns the
    # project.
    author="Peter Baumgartner",  # Optional
    # This should be a valid email address corresponding to the author listed
    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.
    # `src/`, it is necessary to specify the `package_dir` argument.
    # package_dir={"": "viz"},  # Optional
    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(),  # Required

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    entry_points={  # Optional
